# About

Package argon2 implements the key derivation function Argon2. Argon2 was selected as the winner of the Password Hashing
Competition and can be used to derive cryptographic keys from passwords.

This package is a fork of golang.org/x/crypto/argon2. Changes introduced only affect package's public API. Full Argon2
functionality is exposed for the sake of completeness.
